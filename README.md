# sports-betting

This is an app created using https://www.streamlit.io/

Install with `pip install streamlit`

To start collecting data: 
1. add the API key to `betting.py`
2. at the bottom of `betting.py`, update the filename we want to save the odds to
3. then run it with `python betting.py`. It will collect live sports odds every minute

In another terminal, `streamlit run betting_app.py`

The programs can run together or individually
